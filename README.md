# Udakart - Capston project

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mgonawala/udagram-microservices.svg?branch=feature-travis-ci)

This project is a part of Udacity Cloud Developer nanodegree.
Main goal is to learn how to divide a monolith application into microservices.

Project is a simple Shopping Cart application that is built with Microservices architecture.

**Microservices**:

1.  User Service: This service handles User login & signup features.
2.  Product Service: This service maintains a catalogue of all the products available for purchase.
3.  Order Service: This service handles Order creation & provides features to get order history of a user.

**Client**:

Client application a React App that consumes above Microservices &
provides an interface for user to a make purchase.


#### Goals

1.  Application should allow users to signup and login via a web client.
2.  It should allow users to add item into the shopping cart.
3.  It should allow users to place an order.
4.  It should allow users to find  their order history.
5.  It should allow an admin user to add a new Item or update an existing item.
6.  It should allow an admin user to upload an image of the product into AWS s3 bucket.
7.  Each service should be containerized and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
8.  Each service should be able to scale out and scale in independently.
9.  Application should have integrated CI/CD process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a copy of the project and run it on local system or on AWS EKS cluster.

### Prerequisites

1. Install below dependencies.

    [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    
    [Docker-compose]()
  
    [AWS cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
  
    [Eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
  
    [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)


### Instalation & setup

* Clone this project on your local machine

````
git clone https://github.com/mgonawala/udagram-microservices.git
````

* Build docker images for each service
```
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml build
```

* Check docker images on local docker registry after successful build.

````
docker images
````

* Set Environment variables

create a .env file & set environment variables

````
POSTGRESS_USERNAME: "your_username"
POSTGRESS_PASSWORD: "your_password" 
POSTGRESS_DB: "your_db" 
POSTGRESS_HOST: "your_db_host" 
AWS_REGION: "your_aws_region" 
AWS_PROFILE: "your_profile" 
AWS_BUCKET: "your_bucket"
JWT_SECRET: "any_long_secret_key"
USERS_SERVICE: user:8080
PRODUCTS_SERVICE: item:8080
````

* Run whole application locally

````
docker-compose up
````

* Check if you application is running

```
Backend:
curl http://localhost:8085/api/v0/products

```

* Go to localhost:3000 in browser and see if it is working as per below.

* push docker images to docker hub registry

```
docker login -u username -p password
docker-compose push
```

* Check your docker images in docker hub registry

## Deploy application on Local cluster using Minikube

* Edit aws-secret.yaml file with your base64 encoded ~/.aws/credentials file

`cat ~/.aws/credentials | base64 `

* Edit env-cofnigmap.yaml file with your connection details

* Edit env-secret file with your DB password and username 

`echo username| base64 ; echo passowrd | base64 `

*  Configure services & gateway on cluster with below commands. It will set up deployemnt, services and gateway.
```
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/aws-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/env-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/env-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/myappinfo.yaml
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/destination-rules.yaml
kubectl apply -f udacity-c3-deployment/kubconfig/myapp-gateway.yaml
```

* Check your deployments
```
kubectl get deployment
```

![deployments](screenshots/cluster-deployments.png)

* check your services
```
kubectl get svc
```

![services](screenshots/cluster-services.png)

* Browse to ``http://localhost:3000/`` to check if your application is running.

## Rolling update

This section demonstrates how to rollout update with little downtime.
To update the deployed image of Item service, issue following command

`Kubectl set image deployment/item-v1 item=mohinigonawala90/item:3`

`deployment.extensions/frontend image updated`

## CI/CD with travis CI

This application is configured with Travis CI for continuous Integration/continuous deployment.
Each commit on the GitHUB will trigger a build & deploy to AWS EKS cluster.

![travis](screenshots/Travis-deployment.png)

## To setup your own pipeline please follow below steps:

1.  Go to Travis-ci.com and sign up with your GitHub account.
2.  Accept the authorization of Travis CI. You'll be redirected to GitHUB.
3.  Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click Settings, and toggle the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
4.  Set environment variables in Travis DOCKER_USER and DOCKER_PASSWORD. These are referred in .travis.yaml file.

If you have a cloud cluster enabled, set below environment variables.

5.  EKS_CA = `$(kubectl config view --flatten --output=json | jq --raw-output '.clusters[0] .cluster ["certificate-authority-data"]')`
6.  EKS_CLUSTER_HOST = `$(kubectl config view --flatten --output=json | jq --raw-output '.clusters[0] .cluster ["server"]')`
7.  EKS_CLUSTER_NAME = Your_cluster_name
8.  EKS_CLUSTER_USER_NAME = Your_cluster_user_name
9.  TOKEN = `kubectl get secret "${SECRET_NAME}" --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" -o json | jq -r '.data["token"]' | base64 -D`
    SECRET will be your service-account-token
10. Make sure your service account has roles attached to list, patch, udpate deployemnt.
11. Run `kubctl udacity-d3-deployment/kubconfig/roleconfig.yaml` to set up roles.
